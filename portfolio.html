<h2 align="center">This is "Gorilla" Warfare. Basically, using a pop-up questionnaire, you can ask the veteran gorilla different questions about his past experiences in the military. After each question, you are asked if you would like to continue to ask questions. If not, the program will close out.</h2>

<img src="d.PNG" alt="fish game" style="width:75%">
<h2 align="center">This is a carnival fish game where you have 10 seconds to collect as many fish in the net as possible. Through the use of while loops, the fish are able to move randomly, starting at a random place, and at a random speed while the timer is still running. After it ends, the fish disappear and your final score is shown. </h2>
